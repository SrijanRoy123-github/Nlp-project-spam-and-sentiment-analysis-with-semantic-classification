Built a compact, Kaggle-ready NLP notebook that performs text triage: trains a TF-IDF + Logistic Regression spam classifier on the UCI SMS Spam Collection, optionally adds an external dataset download to train a sentiment classifier on the IMDb Large Movie Review Dataset, and creates a lightweight semantic search index over a combined corpus using TF-IDF embeddings + NearestNeighbors for fast similarity lookup; all artifacts (`spam.pkl`, `sent.pkl`, `vec.pkl`, `nn.pkl`, `corpus.pkl`) are saved to the working directory, with a small demo that classifies sample texts and retrieves nearest matches for a query.
